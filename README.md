# System Monitoring Dashboard

A Python-based command-line tool for monitoring real-time system performance metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, and network activity.

## Features
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Displays CPU, memory, disk, and network statistics in real-time.
- **Alerts**: Notifies users when resource usage exceeds defined thresholds (e.g., CPU > 80%).
- **User-Friendly**: Graceful termination with `Ctrl + C`.
- **Extensible**: Future plans include logging metrics and creating graphical visualizations.

## Example Output
